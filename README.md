# Scalable Hyper-parameter Optimization using RAPIDS and AWS

Presented at [PyBay](http://pybay.com/) in August 2020. This repository contains the follwing:
1. Code for CPU based scalability
2. Link for GPU based scalabilty: To be updated soon
2. Slides: To be updated soon
3. Video Recording of the talk: To be updated soon

## Instructions:
You can find the instructions [here](https://github.com/copperwiring/scalable-hpo-pybay/blob/master/papermill_demo/README.md). The instructions cover:

* Setting up the docker conatiner
* Mounting the code from host system to docker container
* Installing [papermill](https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and related dependencies
* Running the parameterized XGBoost demo notebook both sequentially and parallely using multiprocessing
